\section{Introduction}
In the following experiment our aim is to demonstrate the fractal nature 
of a very simple physical object: a small tin foil ball. 

Fractal objects are objects which are characterised of the self-similarity 
property, in simpler words, they look the same when observed at different scales.
One of the most famous fractal object is the Mandelbrot set, but we can find these 
objects also in nature, such as in the structure of a Romanesco Caullflower, or 
from a physical point of view, polymers can be regarded as fractals as well.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{Cauliflower.jpg}
    \caption{An example of cauliflower seen from far away (left) and from up close (right)}
    \label{fig:Cauliflower}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{1\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width = 0.42\textwidth]{Mandelbrot_far.jpg}
        \includegraphics[width = 0.45\textwidth]{Mandelbrot_close.jpg}
    \end{minipage}
    \caption{The Mandelbrot set seen from far away (left) and from up close (right)}
    \label{fig:Mandelbrot}
\end{figure}

We can observe the same level of complexity of the images as seen from far away 
and up close in Fig \ref{fig:Cauliflower} and Fig \ref{fig:Mandelbrot} above.

From the mathematical point of view, we have to define a fractal from its changes 
in terms of mass and volume. We start from an object that we know: a square sheet 
of paper. In this case we will have the mass distributed following the area of 
the sheet, furthermore the mass grows as the square of the typical lenght of the 
sheet (the side of the square which we will call $r$). The formula will be the 
following 
\[ M = C r^2 \]
where $C$ is the surface density of the material of the sheet. We can say that the 
dimension on the sheet of paper is equal to the exponent $2$.

We can repat the same reasoning with a metal cube, obtaining ultimately the formula
\[ M = D r^3 \]
where $D$ is the volume density of the metal used. It has of course $3$ dimensions.

Now let's apply this method to our experiment. Since the physical data which we 
will obtain will be the mass and the linear dimension of the system 
(the tin foil ball), the unknown parameters will be the general density $k$ and 
the dimensionality exponent $\alpha$ in the formula
\begin{equation} 
    M_{\text{experimental}} = k r_{\text{experimental}}^{\alpha}
    \label{eq:gen_fractal}
\end{equation}   

To sum up, in the following experiment we will see that also a rolled up ball of 
tin foil can be considered as a fractal.


% Materials and Methods (Tools and Procedure)
\section{Materials and Methods}
\subsection{Equipment and Tools}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Precision balance
    \item Caliber
    \item Micrometer
    \item Drawing rule and square
    \item Scissors
    \item Aluminum foil
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Procedure}
We begin checking that we have everything at our disposal (Fig \ref{fig:lab_instr}).
Then we start off from the aluminum foil and we cut, using the scissors, a few square sheets of tin foil. 
We have to be careful in cutting squares as perfect as possible in order to reduce the error in 
the measurementes, to do so we make use of both the ruler and the square. We cut square of linear 
dimension of $2mm$, $5mm$, $8mm$, $11mm$, $14mm$, $17mm$, $20mm$, $23mm$, $26mm$ and $29mm$.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.55\textwidth]{Lab_instruments.jpg}
    \caption{Our laboratory setup}
    \label{fig:lab_instr}
\end{figure}

Next, for each square, we measure the mass three times. We also make measurements of the different 
lenghts of the square as represented in Fig \ref{fig:sq_measure}. We create an excel table with 
these measurements.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.35\textwidth]{square_measure.png}
    \caption{All the direction in which we measured the lenght of the side of the aluminum foil squares}
    \label{fig:sq_measure}
\end{figure}

Now, we roll up every tin foil square into a sphere trying to have each ball at the same density (Fig \ref{fig:tf_balls})?????????????????????. 
Since we do this operation by hand, we can only have an idea of its density. This is the step in the 
procedure which adds up the most indetermination in the experiment.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.55\textwidth]{Tin_foil_balls.jpg}
    \caption{Some of the balls that me made from the tin foil, the caliber, some squares of tin foil in the background}
    \label{fig:tf_balls}
\end{figure}

Once finished, our last measurent will be to collect the information of the linear dimension (the radius) 
of each ball. We use the caliber or the micrometer (depending on the size of the ball) to measure the diameter 
of the ball along three different axis. We put this data in an excel spreadsheet.
